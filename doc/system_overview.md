General System Description

ToyRick is a strategic card-battling RPG where players control a weak toy protagonist, ToyRick, striving to defeat powerful boss toys through resource management, upgrades, and tactical card battles. The game revolves around two core progression paths: improving ToyRickâ€™s efficiency in gathering resources and acquiring powerful cards to defeat increasingly challenging bosses.

Core Gameplay Loop:
    Resource Gathering: Collect wood, stone, and gold in the main hub (e.g., mining stone, chopping trees).
    Upgrade or Purchase:
        Upgrade ToyRick: Invest resources to boost gathering speed, unlocking faster progression.
        Buy Card Packs: Spend resources to expand your deck, gaining stronger abilities for boss battles.
    Boss Battles: Use your upgraded stats and curated deck to defeat boss toys in strategic card duels.

Key Components:

    Resource System: Collectible resources (wood, stone, gold) tied to in-world objects (e.g., Tree, Stone).
    Character Progression: Upgradable stats via a Shop.
    Card Collection: Unlockable cards (AttackCard, ComboCard) through CardShop.
    Boss Encounters: Unique boss mechanics (BossMob) requiring tailored decks and strategies.

Strategic Focus: Players must balance short-term gains (faster resource farming) against long-term goals (building a boss-ready deck).
